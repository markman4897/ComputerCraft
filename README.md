# ComputerCraft
My APIs and programs for ComputerCraft

## Changelog:
Changelog might be a bit unusual because to test the scripts I actually run them ingame which means that for most any change I have to push the code here and then download it via ingame means.


## ToDo:
### Urgent:
- separate programs by device (pc/turtle/portable) and separate turtle type specific programs (noisy, ...)
- separate startups for different devices (so main startup knows what to run and not everything)
- add function to ta.lua to disable inventory space checking when moving around (aka if you dont want dig functions to run deposit and want to handle that differently)

### Needed:
- write builder program that reads 3D schematics files (layer by layer) and can build going up or down (written in schematic) and supports multiple materials (from slots or by id)

### Other:
- write short documentation here
- add help to APIs
- add help to programs
- move version from globalVariables.cfg to startup (?) and update startup and init.lua
