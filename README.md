# ComputerCraft
My APIs and programs for ComputerCraft

## Changelog:
Changelog might be a bit unusual because to test the scripts I actually run them ingame which means that for most any change I have to push the code here and then download it via ingame means.


## ToDo:
### Urgent:
- add function to ta.lua to disable inventory space checking when moving around (aka if you dont want dig functions to run deposit and want to handle that differently)

### Needed:
- tune and improve fly.lua for normal usage if possible
- write builder program that reads 3D schematics files (layer by layer) and can build going up or down (written in schematic) and supports multiple materials (from slots or by id)
- fix lumberjack.lua into something logical
- make a turtle program to accompany the diskInstaller.lua program (so it places, turns on, waits and breaks turtles for true auto updating)

### Other:
- write short documentation here
- add help to APIs
- add help to programs
- move and improve misc/displayPrices.lua to apis for csv handling
- prettify comments in computer/diskInstaller.lua (add instructions for usage)
- fix startup arguments so they follow the general rules
- add comments and documentation comments in startup to install func
- go through all programs and replace [INFO] etc tags with appropriate ga.lua func
- make a disk installer program for offline use (just in case)
