# ComputerCraft
My APIs and programs for ComputerCraft

## Changelog:
Changelog might be a bit unusual because to test the scripts I actually run them ingame which means that for most any change I have to push the code here and then download it via ingame means.


## ToDo:
- make lumberjack program
- write short documentation here
- add help to APIs
- add help to programs
- move version from globalVariables.cfg to startup (?) and update startup and init.lua
- maybe merge init to a function in startup and make startup call itself for installing the framework
